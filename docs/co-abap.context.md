## Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Place the vsp binary in the project root (or let install-vsp.ts fetch it)
#    Source: https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk/releases (pinned v2.60.0 at remediation time;
#    SHA256-verified against the release's checksums.txt by scripts/co-abap/install-vsp.ts)
cp /path/to/vsp ./vsp
chmod +x ./vsp          # macOS/Linux
# Windows: copy vsp.exe to project root

# 2. Configure SAP credentials
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env — fill in SAP_URL, SAP_USER, SAP_PASSWORD

# 3. Activate git hooks
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# 4. Verify connection
./vsp health
```

Required env keys (see `.env.sample`):
- `SAP_URL` — SAP system base URL (e.g. `https://my-sap-host:44300`)
- `SAP_USER` — SAP username
- `SAP_PASSWORD` — SAP password
- `SAP_MODE` — MCP mode (default: `hyperfocused`)

## Development Workflow

> See [`docs/phase-definitions.md`](phase-definitions.md) for the full 6-step orchestration
> workflow, the orchestration-step ↔ agent-phase numbering map, and the PM facilitation table.

```bash
# 1. Start a task — PM triage convention (NOT a registered command):
#    hand the request to the PM; the PM classifies it, creates the task file,
#    and dispatches parallel research.
# 2. After implementation — PM-orchestrated conventions (NOT registered commands):
#    post-write QA chain  SyntaxCheck → RunUnitTests → GetCodeCoverage → RunATCCheck
#    transport step       the PM dispatches devops-admin to create/release the CTS transport
```

> **Requirements-Driven Deliverables Workflow (Stage 1 to 5)**:
> All requirements are organized inside `/deliverables/REQ-NNN-[slug]/` using numbered prefixes:
> - `01_srs.md` (Stage 1: Requirements Definition — Owner: Module Analyst / PM)
> - `02_technical_design.md` (Stage 2: Technical Design — Owner: Architect & DBA)
> - `03_implementation_report.md` (Stage 3: Implementation Summary — Owner: Specialist Developers)
> - `04_qa_report.md` (Stage 4: QA & Verification — Owner: QA Engineer)
> - Release & sync (Stage 5 — Owner: PM & DevOps/Admin)

## Git / PR Workflow

See `docs/context.md` § Git / PR Workflow for the full `/sync` pipeline (memlog → MEMORY.md
index update → CHANGELOG.md → audit → branch → commit/push → PR). No content override —
`co-abap`'s only variant-specific rule is ordering: `/sync "feat: description"` always runs
**after** `/transport` (Development Workflow step 2, above) — the CTS transport must be
created/released before the git-side commit, or the two are out of sync.

Manual equivalent: `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts "feat: description"`.

## Deployed vsp Binary

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Binary | `vsp.exe` (project root) |
| Version | `2.38.1` (commit: a75fbfd9, built: 2026-04-07) |
| Last Modified | 2026-05-01 |
| Mode | `hyperfocused` (see `.mcp.json`) |

> To upgrade: replace `vsp.exe` with the new binary and update this table.

---

## MCP Configuration

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json` (Single Source of Truth).

> **Policy**: `.mcp.json` is tracked in git as a shared configuration template. It must NEVER contain credentials. All secrets must be stored in `.env` (gitignored). This is enforced by the pre-commit hook.

> **Duplication Note**: MCP server definitions exist in 3 locations — `.mcp.json` (SSOT), `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code), and `.gemini/settings.json` (Gemini CLI). The pre-commit hook (Step 5) detects drift between these files. Run `bun scripts/sync-mcp.ts` to propagate `.mcp.json` changes to the other two files automatically (`--check` for drift report only).

See `.mcp.json` for the complete server list.

> **Trust decision (documented)**: `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` in `.claude/settings.json`
> and `.gemini/settings.json` auto-enables every MCP server declared in `.mcp.json` — including
> the third-party `abap-docs` / `sap-docs` HTTP endpoints. This is a deliberate convenience trade-off
> for this variant; remove the flag or the server entries to restrict to first-party (`abap`) only.

> **Note**: This project uses the standard `SAP_*` prefix format for connection and feature flags (e.g. `SAP_MODE`, `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES`), ensuring 100% compatibility with the upstream `vsp` engine.

## ABAP Development

### System Defaults
- System: NPL, Client: 001
- Host: vhcalnplci:50000
- ABAP Version: 7.52 (Verified via `vsp system info`)
- Package: `$TMP` (no transport required)

### Directory Reference

| Directory | Purpose | Git-tracked? |
|-----------|---------|:---:|
| `agents/` | Agent role definitions (`.md` files) for all AI tools | Yes |
| `skills/` | Skill definitions (`SKILL.md`) loaded per-session | Yes |
| `docs/` | Shared engineering documentation | Yes |
| `memory/` | Date-stamped development logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) | Yes |
| `scratch/tasks/` | Active task handoff files (created by `/new-task`) | Yes |
| `scratch/stable/` | Exported ABAP sources kept for reference (read-only snapshots) | Yes |
| `scratch/temp/` | Throwaway work files — not committed | No |
| `skills/` | Skill SSOT — synced to `.claude/skills/` and `.gemini/skills/` via `sync-skills.ts` | Yes |
| `.agents/` (other) | Claude Code plugin runtime cache (auto-generated by Desktop App) | No |
| `.claude/worktrees/` | Parallel session worktrees (auto-managed by Desktop App) | No |

### vsp Tool Reference (Hyperfocused Mode)

> **SSOT** for legacy vsp tool names. `.mcp.json` runs vsp v2.60.0 with `SAP_MODE=hyperfocused`, which exposes **one** MCP tool, `SAP` (hook name `mcp__abap__SAP`), called as `SAP(action, target "TYPE NAME", params)`. Agent files, skills, and templates still use the legacy names below; they must **cite this table** (`docs/co-abap.context.md#vsp-tool-reference-hyperfocused-mode`) and must not restate it. Gate classes (R0-R3) follow [the SAP write-safety gate design §2.0](designs/2026-10-10-sap-write-safety-gate-design.md) and the `hyperfocused` section of `config/sap-action-policy.json` (the policy file wins on conflict). Discover details with `SAP(action="help", target="<action>")`.

| Legacy name | Hyperfocused equivalent | Gate | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------|:----:|-------|
| GetSource | `SAP(action="read", target="CLAS ZCL_X")` (any `TYPE NAME`) | R0 | |

| RunQuery | `SAP(action="query", params={"sql_query":"SELECT ..."})` | R0 | exactly one SELECT, else deny (gate §2.1); DA-4 still applies |
| GetCDSDependencies | `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"analyze_deps", ...})` | R0 | |
| GetCDSImpactAnalysis | `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"cds_impact", ...})` | R0 | also `impact`, `references` |
| GetCDSExposure | `SAP(action="read", target="SRVB ZUI_X_O4")` + `analyze` `references` | R0 | no dedicated sub-type; derive from SRVD/SRVB read |
| GetODataMetadata | `SAP(action="read", target="SRVB <name>")` | R0 | `$metadata` of a published service only via browser/Gateway client |
| SyntaxCheck | `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"syntax_check", ...})` | R1 | evidence `SyntaxCheck` |
| RunUnitTests | `SAP(action="test", params={"object_url":"/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_x"})` | R1 | evidence `RunUnitTests` |
| GetCodeCoverage | `test` with `params.with_coverage=true` (or `coverage`) | R1 | evidence `GetCodeCoverage` only when the flag is set |
| RunATCCheck | `SAP(action="test", params={"type":"atc", ...})` | R1 | evidence `RunATCCheck` |
| TraceExecution | `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"trace_execution", ...})` | R1 | no evidence step |
| ListTraces / GetTrace | `analyze` `type=list_traces` / `get_trace` | R0 | |
| ListSQLTraces / GetSQLTraceState | `analyze` `type=list_sql_traces` / `sql_trace_state` | R0 | |
| GetCallGraph / AnalyzeCallGraph | `analyze` `type=call_graph` (`callers`, `callees`) / `analyze_call_graph` | R0 | |
| ListDumps / GetDump | `analyze` `type=list_dumps` / `get_dump` (`explain_dump`) | R0 | |
| WriteSource / EditSource | `SAP(action="edit", target="CLAS ZCL_X", params={"source":...})`; surgical: `target="EDITSOURCE"` with `old_string`/`new_string` | R2 | package must be allowlisted; resets QA chain; new objects use `create` (R2) |
| Activate | `edit` `target=ACTIVATE` (`ACTIVATE_MULTI`, `ACTIVATE_PACKAGE`) | R2 | does not reset the QA chain |
| ListTransports / GetTransport | `SAP(action="system", params={"type":"list_transports"})` / `get_transport` | R0 | |
| CreateTransport / AddToTransport | `system` `type=create_transport` / `add_transport_object` | R2 | |
| ReleaseTransport | `system` `type=release_transport` | R3 | approval + `passed` evidence for every object |
| GetConnectionInfo / GetSystemInfo | `SAP(action="system", target="CONNECTION")` / `target="INFO"` (also `COMPONENTS`, `FEATURES`) | R0 | `info` action also R0 |
| GetArguments (FM signature) | `SAP(action="rfc", target="FM_NAME")` (`op=describe`, default) | R0 | `op=call`/`run`/`read_table` are R3 |
| RunReport / RunOptions | `debug` `RUN_REPORT` / `rfc` `op=run` | R3 | deny unless approved |
| any delete | `SAP(action="delete", ...)` | R3 | |
| debugging | `SAP(action="debug", ...)` | R3 | whole action is R3 |
| **GetAPIReleaseState** | **none in v2.60.0** | - | C1 check stays manual in ADT per DA-3 (record `C1 not verified` if unavailable) |
| **UI5ListApps / UI5GetApp / UI5GetFileContent** | **none in hyperfocused mode** | - | need `SAP_FEATURE_UI5=on` (off). Fallback: read the BSP repo via `search`/`read` where possible, otherwise read the app from its Git repo/Business Application Studio export |

**Feature flags.** `SAP_FEATURE_UI5`, `SAP_FEATURE_RAP`, `SAP_FEATURE_TRANSPORT`, and `SAP_FEATURE_ABAPGIT` are **off**. Transport operations above go through `system` and are still classified by the gate. Turning a flag on is a deliberate `.mcp.json` change reviewed by the PM; deploy-type tools it unlocks (UI5/RAP/abapGit deploy) are R3 and need explicit approval per gate §2.2.

**Scope limits.** SAPscript (SE71), Smart Forms (SMARTFORMS), and Adobe Forms (SFP) **layouts are not editable via ADT/vsp**; their print programs, driver classes, and interface-feeding code are. Layout work is a human GUI step recorded in the forms design. SAP GUI scripting is **outside the MCP gate** and must not be used to bypass it.

### ABAP Development Rules
- **Naming**: `ZCL_` (class), `ZIF_` (interface), `ZPROG_` (program).
- **Isolation**: All local `.abap` files must be created ONLY in the `scratch/` directory.
- **Write Operations**: Use `EditSource` for small changes. Always run `SyntaxCheck` before `WriteSource`.
- **QA Chain**: After any logic change or edit, the `Post-Write Mandatory Chain` MUST be executed (`SyntaxCheck` → `RunUnitTests` → `GetCodeCoverage` → `RunATCCheck`). Priority 1 findings block deployment; coverage below 70% on new objects blocks proceeding to ATC unless waived. See [skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md — Post-Write Mandatory Chain](../skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md) for details. **Note**: If your environment (e.g., Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop App) does not support automatic PostToolUse hooks, you MUST execute this chain manually.
- **Final Audit**: Before any sync/commit, run the `sap:documentation-audit` skill.

### Data Access Rules (CDS-First & SQL Quality)

> **SSOT** for ABAP data-access rules. Agent files, skills, templates, and the Clean ABAP checklist cite these rules by ID (DA-1..DA-8) and must not restate them.

#### DA-1 Release Detection
Before choosing a data-access approach, determine the system release: check the `S4CORE` software component in the installed components table (e.g. `CVERS`; verify the table name on the target) via `RunQuery`, or check whether an `I_*` view resolves via `SearchObject`. If the release cannot be determined, treat the system as non-VDM (Open SQL) and record `System release: unknown`.

#### DA-2 Scope Decision Table

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| New object on S/4HANA | CDS-first (DA-3) applies |
| Existing object, bug fix without a new read | Keep the existing pattern; no rationale required |
| Existing object, new `SELECT` added | DA-3 applies to the new statement only; untouched statements unchanged |
| Any existing statement converted to CDS | DA-6 applies (the conversion itself is optional) |
| ECC / non-VDM system | Open SQL under DA-4; CDS optional |

#### DA-3 Priority Order (When in Scope)
1. Released standard CDS (`I_*`) with C1 release state verified on the target system
2. Custom CDS (`ZI_` / `ZR_` / `ZC_`, see DA-8)
3. Open SQL with DB pushdown
4. AMDP, with written justification

Any fallback below level 2 requires a one-line rationale. **C1 verification**: no repository tool reads the API release state (`GetAPIReleaseState` is absent); verify in ADT (API State / "Use in Cloud Development") on the target system. If not verifiable, record `C1 not verified` and use level 2 with rationale.

#### DA-4 SQL Quality Baseline
Applies to statements written or modified in the change. Untouched legacy statements are not violations (they may be flagged as out of scope).
- No `SELECT` inside `LOOP` and no `SELECT ... ENDSELECT` — use `INTO TABLE`, `JOIN`, or CDS.
- No `SELECT *`.
- `WHERE` supported by key/index; no expressions or casts on key fields in `WHERE`.
- `SELECT SINGLE` only with the full key; otherwise `UP TO 1 ROWS` with `ORDER BY`.
- `FOR ALL ENTRIES`: explicit `IF itab IS NOT INITIAL` guard (an empty driver reads the full table); select the full key or accept the implicit `DISTINCT`; no aggregates; de-duplicate the driver; prefer `JOIN`/CDS when the data is DB-resident.
- Aggregate on the DB for large results.
- Client handling: never hardcode `MANDT`; consider CDS `@ClientHandling`; AMDP/native SQL handle the client explicitly (`USING CLIENT` / `MANDT` parameter).
- Buffered tables: prefer `SELECT SINGLE` on fully buffered customizing tables; do not pull them into large joins or use `BYPASSING BUFFER` without reason.

#### DA-5 CDS Authorization
Every new CDS view exposing Z/Y or business data — including composites of `I_*` views — carries `@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK` and a DCL mapped to named authorization objects.
- `#NOT_REQUIRED` is forbidden; `#PRIVILEGED_ONLY` only with `security-monitor` sign-off.
- Never set `#NOT_REQUIRED` on a wrapper of a view that has its own check.
- The DCL is active on the target system.
- A negative test (user without authorization gets zero rows / an error) is attached.
- The NL-analytics layer is stricter than DA-5 and excludes `#PRIVILEGED_ONLY` views entirely, with no template, free-form SQL, or break-glass path able to reach them (see `docs/designs/2026-10-10-sap-nl-analytics-semantic-layer-design.md`, runtime authorization).

#### DA-6 CDS Conversion Regression
Any conversion of existing logic to CDS (including during maintenance) requires:
- Before/after comparison on the same selection with representative volume: row count equal; totals equal within a stated rounding tolerance, any difference explained.
- SQL/performance trace before and after on the same selection.

Roles: `code-writer` records the old/new statements and requests the run; `test-runner` executes and attaches the results; `dba` reviews the trace. "Pending" is allowed in the `code-writer` report until `test-runner` attaches the evidence.

#### DA-7 CDS Stack Depth
Heuristic review trigger, not a hard limit (SAP VDM stacks of 4-6 levels are normal). Review with `dba` if the stack exceeds 4 levels counted from the base table, joins inflate rows through the stack, or filters/parameters cannot be pushed down to the lowest view.

#### DA-8 Custom CDS Naming (VDM-Aligned)

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `ZI_` | Interface / basic view |
| `ZR_` | RAP root / business-object base view |
| `ZC_` | Consumption / query / projection view |

A "Z wrapper CDS" is a `ZI_` view whose main source is a Z/Y table.

**RAP layer (VDM/RAP-aligned convention):**

| Artifact | Name | Rule |
|----------|------|------|
| Root view entity (R layer) | `ZR_<Entity>` | `define root view entity`, over `ZI_`/table |
| Projection view (C layer) | `ZC_<Entity>` | `as projection on ZR_<Entity>`; one per consumption scenario |
| Metadata extension (DDLX) | same name as the annotated view, e.g. `ZC_<Entity>` | `@Metadata.layer: #CUSTOMER`; UI annotations live here, not in the view |
| Behavior definition (BDEF) | same name as its view: `ZR_<Entity>` (base), `ZC_<Entity>` (projection) | behavior pool class `ZBP_R_<Entity>` |
| Access control (DCLS) | same name as the protected view | DA-5 |
| Service definition (SRVD) | `ZUI_<Entity>` (UI) / `ZAPI_<Entity>` (Web API) | exposes `ZC_` entities only |
| Service binding (SRVB) | `ZUI_<Entity>_O4` / `ZUI_<Entity>_O2` / `ZAPI_<Entity>_O4` | suffix = protocol (`_O2` OData V2, `_O4` OData V4) |

### ABAP SQL Reference (All Agents)

> All agents that run `RunQuery` MUST follow these rules. For ABAP code (not ad-hoc queries), the SQL quality baseline is [DA-4](#da-4-sql-quality-baseline).

```sql
-- Correct ordering
ORDER BY field DESCENDING        -- NOT: ORDER BY field DESC

-- Row limiting (use max_rows parameter, not SQL LIMIT)
RunQuery(sql=..., max_rows=50)   -- NOT: LIMIT 50 in SQL string

-- Date format
WHERE erdat >= '20260501'        -- YYYYMMDD string, no separators

-- Table aliasing in JOINs
FROM vbak AS a JOIN vbap AS b ON a~vbeln = b~vbeln

-- Field references with tilde
b~matnr    -- NOT: b.matnr

## Upstream VSP Reference Build & Test

> **Note**: The following build and test commands apply to the upstream **vsp** Go engine repository, not this configuration/harness repository.

```bash
go build -o vsp ./cmd/vsp              # Build
go test ./...                           # Unit tests
go test -tags=integration -v ./pkg/adt/ # Integration (needs SAP)
make build-all                          # 9 platforms
```

Key flags: `--mode hyperfocused|focused|expert` (Note: `hyperfocused` is the standard mode for all AI agents), `--read-only`, `--allowed-packages "Z*"`, `--disabled-groups 5THD`

> **Note on hyperfocused mode**: Despite the name, `hyperfocused` mode registers all 101 individual MCP tools (GetSource, GetODataMetadata, RunQuery, etc.) — not a single unified tool. The mode restricts which SAP **packages** and **features** are accessible, not which MCP tools are registered. Agent files may reference all their tools normally when `SAP_MODE=hyperfocused`.

internal/mcp/
  handlers_*.go       Domain handlers (read, edit, debug, graph, ...)
  tools_register.go   Registration + mode logic
  tools_focused.go    Focused mode whitelist
  handlers_universal.go  Hyperfocused single-tool (SAP)
pkg/
  adt/                ADT client (HTTP, CSRF, sessions, all SAP ops)
  graph/              Dependency graph engine (in progress)
  ctxcomp/            Context compression (dep resolution for read)
  abaplint/           ABAP lexer + parser (91 statements, 8 lint rules)
  dsl/                Fluent API, YAML workflows, batch ops
  cache/              In-memory + SQLite
  scripting/          Lua engine

## Adding a New MCP Tool in Upstream VSP

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only relevant when contributing to the upstream vsp engine source repository.

1. Handler in `handlers_*.go`:
```go
func (s *Server) handleX(ctx context.Context, req mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    name, _ := req.GetArguments()["name"].(string)
    result, err := s.adtClient.Method(ctx, name)
    if err != nil { return newToolResultError(err.Error()), nil }
    return mcp.NewToolResultText(format(result)), nil
}
```
2. Register in `tools_register.go` with `shouldRegister("X")`
3. Route in `handlers_analysis.go` (or appropriate router)
4. Add to `tools_focused.go` if needed in focused mode

---

## Upstream VSP / SAP Runtime Common Issues

1. **CSRF errors** — auto-refreshed in `http.go`
2. **Lock conflicts** — edit handler does auto lock/unlock
3. **Session issues** — some CRUD/debugger flows are session-sensitive; verify stateful/stateless before changing transport or auth logic
4. **Auth** — use basic OR cookies, not both
5. **ZADT_VSP** — WebSocket debug/RFC/RunReport require it installed on SAP

> Security and sanitization rules are in [security.md](security.md) (inherited from `templates/common/docs/_common/security.md` at scaffold time).

---

## Project-Specific Rules

> These rules apply equally to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Antigravity, and any other AI tool operating in this project. Tool-specific overrides live in `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.codex/`.

### Memory Logging (ABAP)

Whenever an ABAP program, class, interface, or other object is **created or significantly changed**, append an entry to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Required fields per entry:
- **Object name, type, package, and ADT URL**
- **Purpose summary** (what it does, what it queries, how it outputs)
- **Key technical decisions** (design choices, reasons, alternatives considered)
- **Issue history** (symptom → root cause → resolution)
- **MCP / config changes** (`.mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, etc.)

**When to read**: Only when a recurring error occurs or when uncertain about a past design decision. Do **not** read memory files on every session start. All entries must be written in **English**.

**Scope boundary** — `memory/` and `CHANGELOG.md` serve different purposes and must not be conflated:

| Change type | Record in |
|-------------|-----------|
| ABAP object created or significantly modified | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Harness infrastructure changed (agents, skills, scripts, docs, config) | `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` section |

### Documentation Language

All `.md` files must be written in **English**. **Exception**: files whose name contains `_ko` (e.g., `README_ko.md`) must be written entirely in Korean.

### Documentation Synchronization

`templates/common/docs/context.md` is the **single source of truth** for shared engineering content (inherited by this variant; the variant's own context file is `docs/co-abap.context.md`).

| Change type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Shared content (build, codebase, rules, issues) | Update `templates/common/docs/context.md` only |
| Tool-specific config or skill | Update `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `.codex/` only |
| Agent roles or workflow | Update `AGENTS.md`; reflect summary in `templates/common/docs/context.md` |
| ABAP-specific configuration | Update `docs/co-abap.context.md` only |

Do **not** copy shared sections from `templates/common/docs/context.md` into tool-specific files.

### Initial Context Files
<!-- Files listed here MUST be loaded at the start of EVERY session by ALL AI tools. -->
<!-- The exact loading mechanism (e.g., '@' syntax or 'Read' commands) is tool-specific and defined in CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md. -->
- `docs/co-abap.context.md` - Full architecture map, standards, ABAP-specific tech stack (shared base: `templates/common/docs/context.md`)
- `AGENTS.md` - Canonical agent roster
- `memory/MEMORY.md` - Recent session history (if exists)
- `skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md` - Always load for SAP ABAP development tasks
- `skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md` - Always load; mandatory QA chain after any WriteSource/EditSource

### Git Commit Policy & Reflection

All development artifacts (ABAP sources, docs, research reports) and memory logs must be committed to the local Git repository. The PM agent verifies repository status and memory file existence at the end of each major task.

**Manual Commit Rule**: Because auto-commits and hooks are disabled or unsupported in many AI CLI sessions (like Gemini or Claude Desktop), you must run `git add -A && git commit` manually or use the project synchronization script (`bun scripts/dev-sync.ts`) at the end of each task.

### Tooling Matrix

For a full comparison of tool capabilities (Claude Code CLI vs Desktop App vs Antigravity vs Gemini CLI) and hook behavior by environment, see [docs/tooling-matrix.md](tooling-matrix.md).

## Areas Requiring Care

| Area | Risk | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `pkg/graph/` | New, incomplete | Only parser adapter; SQL/ADT adapters pending |
| `handlers_debugger.go` | WebSocket-only | REST breakpoints 403 on newer SAP; use ZADT_VSP |
| `handlers_amdp.go` | Experimental | Session works, breakpoints unreliable |
| `pkg/adt/ui5.go` | Read-only | Write needs `/UI5/CL_REPOSITORY_LOAD` |
| `pkg/llvm2abap/`, `pkg/wasmcomp/` | Research | Not production; don't treat as stable |
| `pkg/adt/debugger.go` (REST) | Deprecated | Prefer `websocket_debug.go` |
| `../agents/*` | Config drift | Codex TOML format may differ from Claude/Gemini JSON docs |
| `.codex/config.toml` | Tool parity | Keep MCP servers, hook enablement, and `skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md` skill loading aligned with Claude/Gemini settings |

<!-- VARIANT-INJECT: guidelines [REQUIRED] -->
## Coding Guidelines (ABAP Supplement)

### 1. Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. If uncertain, ask — don't guess silently.
- **Secrets**: Never hardcode passwords, API tokens, or keys. Always use env vars / `.env.sample`.

### 2. Simplicity First
- Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

### 3. Surgical Changes
- Touch only what is necessary. Don't "improve" adjacent code.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Convert every task into a verifiable goal before starting.

### 5. Response Language
- All **conversational** replies — **Korean** by default.
- All code, config, commit messages, PR titles, branch names, **CHANGELOG.md**, and **memory/` logs — **English only**.
<!-- END VARIANT-INJECT -->

---

## Auto-Updating & Context Maintenance

- **Trigger**: Agents MUST automatically append a summary to the `memory/MEMORY.md` or update architecture sections in `docs/co-abap.context.md` whenever a significant architectural decision or multi-file feature is completed.
- **Archiving**: If `docs/co-abap.context.md` or logs become too unwieldy, older decisions should be archived to `memory/`.

## Dynamic Roster & Skills Note
**Note:** The agent and skills lists in this project may be dynamically expanded by the PM orchestrator during the Kickoff Phase based on emerging requirements.

## Tracking Management: CHANGELOG vs. Memory
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: For end-users and release notes. Record *what* changed (features, fixes) using structured categories. **(Must be written in English)**
- **`memory/` logs**: For developers and AI agents. Record *how* and *why* changes were made, including architectural decisions and debugging context. **(Must be written in English)**

## File Encoding Rule (Markdown & Scripts)
- All text files, including Markdown (.md) and scripts (.ps1, .sh, .py, .js, etc.), must be saved as **UTF-8 (without BOM)**.
- All text files must use **LF** line endings. `.gitattributes` defines the checkout policy, and `bun scripts/audit.ts` detects violations.
- Script outputs (Add-Content, Set-Content) must explicitly specify -Encoding UTF8.

<!-- COMMON-CONTEXT:START -->
### Instruction Standard (LLM Interaction Standard, ADR-0098)

Human-to-LLM instructions and LLM-to-human answers follow the project-local standard `docs/standards/llm-interaction-standard.md` (ADR-0098, extending ADR-0079) — "Precision In, Intuition Out".

- **Input (§2)**: one primary action per instruction; explicit verbs; defined terms; structural rules in §2.8 — one instruction per sentence (≤ 20 words procedural / ≤ 25 descriptive), active voice with imperative steps, present tense, no idioms, positive phrasing preferred, minimal pronouns. Applies to requirement statements, task briefs, execution-plan task descriptions, agent dispatch prompts, design-doc requirement sections, API endpoint documentation, and how-to steps.
- **Output (§4–§9)**: conclusion and intuition before implementation detail; mental models before mechanics; facts, inferences, assumptions, and unknowns kept separate.
- **Enforcement**: advisory — PM conforms task briefs at triage; architect checks requirement sections at Design Gate review. Decisions: ADR-0079 and ADR-0098 (workspace root `docs/adr/`).

### PM Team-Management Authority (ADR-0080)

PM owns the composition of this project's agent team and rules on skill changes.

- **Hiring/firing (top-down, PM-decided)**: PM judges timing and target from workflow signals — recurring unmatched work types, role overload, absorbed roles, the periodic roster review — without a blocking user approval. Every decision emits a gate-moment decision record (ADR-0061) before dispatch. Default exit is `status: deprecated`; hard delete requires an explicit user request. Procedure: `agent-lifecycle-manager` skill.
- **Skill requests (bottom-up, agent-initiated, PM-approved)**: agents file structured request blocks (`create|attach|remove` + evidence) in their task reports and memory logs; PM triages and only approved requests are executed — agents never create, attach, or remove skills unilaterally. Procedure: `skill-lifecycle-manager` skill.
- **Enforcement**: governance, not code — decision records capture the judgment trail, and the change audits catch structural drift. Full decision: ADR-0080 in the workspace root `docs/adr/`.
<!-- COMMON-CONTEXT:END -->

<!-- COMMON-CONTEXT:START -->
This project follows the coding standards in the key-rules list below.

Key rules:
- All operational scripts must be TypeScript (`.ts`) — run via `bun scripts/<name>.ts` (ADR-0036; no `.sh`/`.ps1` pairs)
- Git hook scripts in `.githooks/` remain Unix shell (`.sh`) for git compatibility
- All text files saved as **UTF-8 (without BOM)**
- Commit messages and PR artifacts in **English only**
